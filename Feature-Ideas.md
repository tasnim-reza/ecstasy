 ##screen view area.

 if a dom is changed in unseen area
 we actually don't need to change immediately.
 multiple view area. we can prepare multiple view area.
 but we do always only three
 current and next
 if user moved to next then we preserve the old one.
 do we actually need all the manipulated dom persist in browser ? NO

 this.element.createNode('a')
 .addAttribute('data-id',1)
 .addEventListener('onclcik','console.log('call')')
 .render();


 <a data-id="1" onclick="console.log('call') />
